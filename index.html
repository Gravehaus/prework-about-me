      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Server, Podcaster, Artist, Gamer and Blossiming software engineer. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Los Angeles, I transplanted to Seattle in my teenage year with a few pitstops in Guam, Chicago and Alaska.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Unlike the majority of PWN'ers, I prefer to spend my time indoors. From collecting video game paraphanellia to drawing concept art. I run a podcast with my twin sister detailing all things nerdy.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am working towards a leadership role in the vide games industry. Whether program designer or concept artist, working in games is in my trajectory.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In the SLU area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>This is a good opportunity for marketable skills that can help me break in to the industry I dream of working in.</p>
